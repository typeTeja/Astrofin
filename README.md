#### **2. System Architecture**

The astrology software will follow a modern architecture that supports scalability, flexibility, and high availability. The architecture is designed around a **Microservices** approach to allow easy updates and maintenance of individual components. The key components of the architecture include:

1. **Frontend** (User Interface)
   - **Client-Side**: Built with **Next.js** (TypeScript), which allows for fast rendering and a seamless experience across web and mobile platforms.
   - **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS will be used for styling, providing a modern, responsive, and customizable design.
   - **Chart Rendering**: JavaScript libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js) for rendering interactive astrological charts.

2. **Backend** (Business Logic)
   - **API Layer**: **FastAPI** for building high-performance RESTful APIs.
     - FastAPI will serve astrology data (e.g., birth charts, transit data) and handle user requests.
     - **GraphQL** could be integrated for flexibility in querying complex astrology data if necessary.
   - **Astrological Calculations**: Integration with **Swiss Ephemeris** library (via **pyswisseph**) for accurate birth chart and transit calculations.
   - **Authentication**: Integration with **Firebase Authentication** to handle user sign-up, login, and session management.
   - **Database**: **PostgreSQL** with the **asyncpg** driver for asynchronous database interactions to store user data, astrological data, and financial market trends.

3. **Database Layer**
   - **PostgreSQL** will store structured data, including:
     - User profiles and settings
     - Generated charts (stored in a binary or image format)
     - Transaction logs for financial astrology predictions
   - **Redis** can be used for caching frequently requested data to improve performance (e.g., daily forecasts, transit data).

4. **Microservices**
   - **Astrology Calculation Service**: A dedicated service for performing complex astrology calculations.
   - **Financial Astrology Service**: A service for analyzing market trends based on planetary positions and cycles.
   - **Notification Service**: Integrated with **Firebase** for sending push notifications, email, and SMS alerts regarding significant astrological events (e.g., solar/lunar eclipses, important transits).

5. **Deployment and Containerization**
   - **Docker** for containerization of the services, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.
   - **Kubernetes** or **Docker Compose** will be used for orchestrating the containers in a scalable and efficient manner.
   - **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

6. **Hosting & Scalability**
   - **Cloud Provider**: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for hosting services, ensuring scalability, security, and high availability.
   - **Load Balancer**: A reverse proxy and load balancer (e.g., Nginx or HAProxy) to distribute traffic across multiple instances of backend services for high availability.
